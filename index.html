          <h1>Phillip Schofield Confirms Rumors</h1>
          <p>This was not meant to be on television. </p>
			<p>THIS MORNING’S host Phillip Schofield was taken by surprise during an interview with Call The Midwife star Helen George when the actress made a shocking revelation about her co-star Miriam Margolyes’ eating habits.
</p>
			<p>Call The Midwife star Helen George joined Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on the This Morning sofa yesterday to talk about the Christmas special of the hit BBC show and her latest role in the theatre production, My Cousin Rachel. However, when discussing her BBC co-star Miriam Margolyes, who plays Sister Mildred, she dropped a shocking revelation about her eating habits which left Phillip speechless.

</p>
		<p>Phillip spoke about the last time they interviewed Miriam and said: “We had Miriam Margolyes on here the other day, who is amongst our favourite guests in the world, she’s outrageous.

“She’s a scream,” the Helen star remarked.

Referring to Miriam’s guest performance in the Call The Midwife Christmas special, Phillip remarked: “But you found yourself in the Outer Hebrides with her…”

“Cheers, guys,” Helen joked. “You guys practically cast her in the show.

</p>
		<p>“She’s so much fun, she’s got the most disgusting potty mouth I’ve ever heard. And she eats a raw onion every morning for breakfast.”

“No she doesn’t!” A shocked Holly quipped. “How did we not know this?”

And Phillip questioned surprised: “Does she?”

“Ask her about it next time, honestly,” Helen said. “She says it’s good for her heart and for her health.”</p>
		<p>“And how is that to work with someone that’s just had a raw onion for breakfast?” Holly asked.

“Well I don’t get that close to her after breakfast, I stay my distance,” Helen joked.

As for what Call the Midwife fans can expect from the Christmas special she explained the plot to Holly and Phillip. 

"We go up there because there's a small community without any medical health care of advisors, nurses or doctors, and there's a community in need so we go up and help in our own way." </p>
<p>Nevertheless, she gave her opinion on why the show is so popular. 

"I think the writing is still really good and there's loads of subjects… I think it holds a mirror up to society," she told Phillip and Holly. 

"Then there's the nostalgia element. There's all these hard-hitting issues but they're wrapped up in the lovely, warm, cosy Sunday night drama that I think people quite enjoy."

Earlier in the week, Holly and Phillip were horrified when a World War II veteran explained his savings had been targeted after paying for a book over the phone. 

Lenny Bannon, and his wife Pat, were welcomed on to the show to discuss how Lenny’s father, Bernard was scammed out of £70,000 worth of life savings
